<p>I am a software developer currently working in <b><i>Advanced Research and Development Team</b></i> at Samsung, India. I am involved in developing an application agnostic framework which gathers data and analyzes the information across all the layers of IO Stack in a distributed ecosystem. It is currently deployed for Redis and RocksDB to carryout the auto-analysis of performance statistics on different storage medias. </p>
 <p>Majorly, I am handling the <b>big data processing using Apache Spark</b> and in developing a <b>Visualzer Tool displaying the big data using d3.js</b>.</p>

<p>Before this, I worked for <b><i>S-Assist Team</i></b> at Samsung where I developed an Artificial Conversational bot using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Algorithms. During this periord, I did extensive research in AI domain and read many research papers. 
 <ul>
  <li>Implemented Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Latent Semantic Indexing for text classification and retrieval</li>
   <li>Designed and implemented Ontology for query expansion</li>
   <li>Worked on the question processing module and implemented answer type detection using NER tagging, NLTK and WordNet</li>
<li>During this project, I also got the opportunity to develop certain machine learning algorithms using Tensorflow.</li>

</ul>
   
<p>Apart from the project, I mentored the interns and <b><i>developed a system for the generation of question-answer pairs from structured and unstructured texts</b></i>. 
</p>
<p>
  I have an experience in <b><i>Web Development & Cloud Computing</b></i> too. At Samsung, I worked on developing a platform independent Client-Server Architecture for embedded device - Cubieboard, Artik-board using Rest APIs, Cloud Server. The application is developed for both Android and Windows and it supports features such as Smart Search (developed using solr/lucene; searches docs shared on the device) , Photo Management(browses photos category-wise, auto-tagging of photos stored on the device ) , File Browser etc. The application allows installing services from cloud to device and is developed using SQlite, Nodejs, HTML,JS, JQuery technologies.
</p>
<p>Prior to this, I have done my internships as a software intern at Siemens, India and Hi-Tech Gears Limited, India. </p>

<p><b><i>I am interested in Machine Learning and Distributed Computing. I am passionate about applying my knowledge of Neural Networks and Deep Learning, especially in the field of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Also, I like exploring the applications of deep learning with Speech Recognition and I like dealing with big data processing.</b></i></p>

<p>I have completed my undergraduation degree (Bachelor of Technology) in <b><i>Computer Science and Engineering</b></i> from <b><i>National Institue of Technology,Warangal (NIT Warangal)</b></i>. </p>

<p>Also, I have completed : </p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Machine Learning Engineer</b> Nanodegree by  Kaggle | <a href="https://in.udacity.com/" > Udacity </a>   | <a href ="https://github.com/user-19/ML-Nanodegree-Udacity" > Projects </a> </li>
<li> <b>Computer Vision Nanodegree</b> by Nvidia, Deep Learning Institute | <a href="https://in.udacity.com/" > Udacity </a>  | <a href = "https://github.com/user-19/Computer-Vision-Nanodegree-Udacity" > Projects </a> </li>
