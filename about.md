### About

I am a software developer currently working in **Advanced Research and Development Team** at Samsung, India. I am involved in developing an application agnostic framework which provides a unique approach to gather data and analyze information across all the layers of IO Stack. It is currently deployed for Redis and RocksDB to carryout the auto-analysis of performance statistics on different storage media. Majorly, I am involved in the data processing using Apache Spark and in developing a Visualzer Tool displaying the big data using d3.js.

Before this, I worked for **S-Assist Team** at Samsung where I played a pivotal role in developing an Artificial Conversational Entity using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Algorithms. I implemented Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Latent Semantic Indexing for text classification and retrieval; Designed and implemented Ontology for query expansion;Worked on the question processing module and implemented answer type detection using NER tagging, NLTK and WordNet.During this project, I also got the opportunity to develop certain machine learning algorithms using Tensorflow.

Apart from the project, I mentored the interns and **developed a system for the generation of question-answer pairs from structured and unstructured texts**. 

I have an experience in **Web Development** too. At Samsung, I worked on developing a platform independent Client-Server Architecture for embedded device - Cubieboard, Artik-board using Rest APIs, Cloud Server. The application is developed for both Android and Windows and it supports features such as Smart Search (developed using solr/lucene; searches docs shared on the device) , Photo Management(browses photos category-wise, auto-tagging of photos stored on the device ) , File Browser etc. The application allows installing services from cloud to device and is developed using SQlite, Nodejs, HTML,JS, JQuery technologies.

Prior to this, I have done my internships as a software intern at Siemens, India and Hi-Tech Gears Limited, India. 

**I am interested in Machine Learning and Distributed Systems. I am passionate about applying my knowledge of Neural Networks and Deep Learning, especially in the field of Computer Vision. Also, I like exploring the applications of deep learning with Natural Language Understanding and Speech Recognition.**

I have completed my undergraduation degree (Bachelor of Technology) in **Computer Science and Engineering** from **National Institue of Technology,Warangal (NIT Warangal)**.

Also, I have completed : 
* **Machine Learning Engineer** Nanodegree by  Kaggle - Udacity  - [Projects](https://github.com/user-19/ML-Nanodegree-Udacity){:target="_blank"}
* **Computer Vision Nanodegree** by Nvidia, Deep Learning Institute  - Udacity - [Projects](https://github.com/user-19/Computer-Vision-Nanodegree-Udacity){:target="_blank"}
* **Big Data Nanodegree**  - Udacity - [Projects](https://github.com/user-19/BigData-Analysis-Nanodegree){:target="_blank"}

Along with these, I have completed a couple of courses related to Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Databases, Big Data Visualization on Coursera too.

In my free time, I like learning new things and contributing to open source.
