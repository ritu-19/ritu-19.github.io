<p><b>Project Overview:</p></b>
<p> The aim of this project is to analyze the NYC Subway Data to find out whether more people ride the subway when it’s raining versus when it’s not. </p>
<p>New York City Subway data is compared and statistical methods and data visualization techniques are used to draw an interesting conclusion about the subway with the dataset that is analyzed.</p> 
<p> The primary goal of this project is to explore the relationship between data from the NYC Subway turnstiles and the city weather.</p>

<p><b> Methodology: </p></b>
<ul>
  <li>  <b> Gathering data from the Internet and Filtering the data </b>: Firstly, I have gathered some required data from Internet using <b> urllib</b> and <b> Beautiful Soup</b> libraries. Then I have loaded the data into <b>Dataframes</b> and performed some filter operations. </li>
  <li>    <b>Using Statistics for Data Analysis:</b>Further I have analyzed the dataset by performing certain queries such as:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Counting the number of days when it 'rains' i.e., in the dataset, 'rain' column = 1</li>
    <li> Calculating if the day was cloudy or not (0 or 1) and the maximum temperature for cloudy days </li>
    <li> Calculating the mean temperatures for the weekends </li>
    <li>Calculating the mean of the minimum temperature  for the days when the minimum temperature was greater that 55 degrees</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Data handling and simple graphics creation with Pandas:</b> Then I have visualized the data by plotting them using histograms.</li>
<p> For example, the below histogram is plotted to analyze the days when it is raining and when it is not.</p>

</ul>

<p><b>Map and Reduce: </b></p> Further, I have created a Mapper and a Reducer for this <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud359/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv" > dataset </a> with 'UNIT' column as 'key' ans analyzed the results. </p>
<p><b>Implementation</b></p><p>Complete Code can be found <a href="https://github.com/user-19/BigData-Analysis-Nanodegree/tree/master/NYC_Subway">here.</a></p>
