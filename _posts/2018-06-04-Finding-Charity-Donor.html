<p><i><b>Project Overview:</i></p></b>
<p>This project is aimed at performing analysis and developing certain supervised learning techniques on the data collected for the U.S. census to help a certain organisation identify people most likely to sonate to their cause.  </p>

<p><b><i>Analysis and Methodology </i></b></p>
<p>
Firstly, the data is explored to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques are applied on the dataset to manipulate the data into a workable format. After that several supervised learners are evaluated on the data, and the one which is best suited for the solution is selected. Afterwards, the model selected is optimized and present it as your solution to CharityML. Finally, the chosen model and its predictions are explored under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.
