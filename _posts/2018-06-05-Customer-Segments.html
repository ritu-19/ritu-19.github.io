<p><i><b>Project Overview:</i></p></b>
<p>In this project unsupervised learning techniques are applied on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. <p>

<p><b>Dataset Used</b</p> <p> The dataset used is taken from UCI ML Repositry <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers">UCI wholeshale Dataset</a>. The dataset contains features (Fresh,Milk,Grocery,Frozen,Detergents_Paper,Delicatessen (Continuous); Channel,Region(Nominal)).
  </p>
  <p><b>Approach and Methodology</b></p>
  <p>1.	Firstly, the data is explored by selecting a small subset to sample and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. Afterwards, the data is preprocessed by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the good, clean customer spending data, PCA transformations are applied to the data and clustering algorithms are implemented to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, the segmentation found is compared with an additional labelling and certain ways are considered that this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.
