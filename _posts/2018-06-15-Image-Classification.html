<p><i><b>Project Overview:</i></p></b>
<p> 1.	In this project, images from the CIFAR-10 dataset are classified. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The images in the dataset are preprocessed, and then a convolutional neural network is trained on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. A convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers is built and then at the end, neural network's predictions on the sample images are examined.
