<p><i><b>Project Overview:</i></p></b>
<p> The aim of this project is to build a convulational neural network using Tensorflow which classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.</p>
<p>To summarize, the images in the dataset are preprocessed, and then a convolutional neural network is trained on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. A convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers are built and then at the end, neural network's predictions on the sample images are examined.</p>

<p><b>Dataset Used:</b></p> The dataset used is taken from <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-10 DATASET</a>. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.</p>
<p><b>Methodology</b></p>
<p><i><b>Data Preprocessing and Exploration:</i></b></p><p> Firstly, the images in the dataset need to be normalized and the corresponding labels need to be one-hot encoded. </p>
<p><i><b>Building the model:</i></b></p><p> A simple neural network has been built with three convoluional and max pool layers, a flatten layer, three fully connected layers, an output layer. I have added dropout layers too in the model. </p> <p> A single optimization has been donw along with the tuning of some hyperparameters (batch_size, epoch, keep_probability) </p>
<p><i>Visualizing the softmax predictions</i></p>
