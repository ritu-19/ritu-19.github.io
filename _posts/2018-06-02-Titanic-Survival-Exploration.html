<p><i><b>Project Overview:</i></p></b>
<p>This project is aimed at creating decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features. Basically, a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest is explored to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive. </p>

<p><i><b>Dataset Used</i><p></b>
<p>The dataset used in this project has:</p>
  <p> <ul>
   <li>Features:</li></p>
   <p>pclass : Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd); name : Name; sex : Sex ; age : Age ; sibsp : Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard ; parch : Number of Parents/Children Aboard; ticket : Ticket Number; fare : Passenger Fare; cabin : Cabin; embarked : Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
</p>
<p>
<li>Target Variable:</li>

    survival : Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
</ul>
</p>
