<p>The aim of this project is to implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a two dimensional world. Based on the map of the environment created, the location of the robot is tracked and the locations of the landmarks such as buildings are identified in the real time.</p>

</p>
<p>
To summarize, for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), information is gathered from a robot's sensors and motions over time, and then use that gathered information about measurements and motion to re-construct a map of the world.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Robot Creation and Movement while sensing the landmarks:</i>
  </p>
<p> First, I have created a robot and allowed it to move around a 2D grid world.</p>
<p> Then, I have defined a sense function for the robot that allows it to sense landmarks in a given world so that the robot keeps track of the  different landmarks that it sees in a 2D grid world .</p>
<p><i>Note: </i>The robot motion and sensors have some uncertainty associated with them.</p>
<p>To create the robot, I have used following parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li> size of world = 10.0  </li>
  <li>range at which landmarks are sensed = 5.0   </li>
  <li>noise in robot motion = 0.2    </li>
  <li>noise in the measurements = 0.2     </li>
</ul>
</p>

  <i> Visualization:</i>

<p> The below image shows the positions of landmarks created in the grid world.</p>

</p>
<p><i>Data:</i></p>
To perform SLAM, a series of robot sensor measurements and motions is collected over a defined period of time.This data is used everytime to re-construct the map of the world with the robot and landmark locations.
