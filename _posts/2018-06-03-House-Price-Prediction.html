<p><i><b>Project Overview:</i></p></b>
<p>The main of the project is to apply basic machine learning concepts on the data collected for housing prices in the Boston, to predict the selling price of a new home.<p>

 <p><i><b>Dataset Used</i><p></b>
<p>The dataset is taken from <a  href=""> UCI Boston Housing </a> . The dataset is modified a little bit.It consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features and 1 target variable as described below:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Features</li>
<p>
  1.  RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
  2.  LSTAT: percentage of population considered lower status
  3.  PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
</p>
<li>Target Variable</li> <p>1. MEDV: median value of owner-occupied homes</p>
</ul></p>
<p><b><i> Analysis and Methodology </i></p></b>

<p><b><i>Data Exploration: </b></i></p><p>First, Data Exploration is done to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. </p>
<p>Second, Splitting the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. 
</p>
<p> During data exploration, I observed the Statistics of the training and testing dataset such as, Maximum, Minimum, standard deviation etc price of the data. And I have used r2_score for measuring the performance. </p>
<p><b><i>Building Model, Analyzing and Visualizing: </b></i></p><p>Third, Analyzing and Visualizing the performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. 
</p>
<p> I used Decision Tree as my model and has used GridSearchCV for tuning the hyperparameters.</p>

<p>The above image shows the Decision Tree Regressor Complexity Performance.</p>
<p><i><b>Optimal Model: </i></b></p><p>Fourth, Picking the optimal model. </p>

<p><b><i> Testing / Prediction Accuracy: </b></i></p><p>Fifth, Finally, Testing the optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to your statistics.</p>

<p><b><i>Implementation:</b></i> Complete Code can be found <a href="https://github.com/user-19/House-Price-Prediction">here</a>.</p>
