<p><b>Project Overview:</p></b>
<p>The main of the project is to apply basic machine learning concepts on the data collected for housing prices in the Boston, to predict the selling price of a new home.<p>

 <p><i><b>Dataset Used</i><p></b>
<p>The dataset is taken from <a  href=""> UCI Boston Housing </a> . The dataset is modified a little bit.It consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features and 1 target variable as described below:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Features</li>
<p>
  1.  RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
  2.  LSTAT: percentage of population considered lower status
  3.  PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
</p>
<li>Target Variable</li> <p>1. MEDV: median value of owner-occupied homes</p>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Data Exploration: </b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, dataset is explored and visualized to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. </p></li>
<li><p>Second, I have Splitted the dataset into testing and training subsets, and have determined a suitable performance metric for solving this problem. 
 </p></li>
<p> <li>During data exploration, I observed the Statistics of the training and testing dataset such as, Maximum, Minimum, standard deviation etc price of the data.</p></li>
<li> I have used <b> r2_score </b> for measuring the performance. </li>

<p><b>Building Model, Analyzing and Visualizing: </b></p><p>I have analyzed and visualized the performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. 
</p>
<p><b> Decision Tree And GridSearchCV: </b></p>
<p> I used <b>Decision Tree</b> as my model and has used <b>GridSearchCV</b> for tuning the hyperparameters. And hence <b> An Optimal Model is being picked.</b></p>

<p>The above image shows the Decision Tree Regressor Complexity Performance.</p>

<p><b> Testing / Prediction Accuracy: </b></p><p>I have tested the optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to the obtained statistics.</p>
